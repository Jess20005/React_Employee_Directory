# React_Employee_Directory

## Overview

This project I created my first employee directory with React.The process required breaking up the application's UI into components, manage component state, and respond to user events.

## User Story

* As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.

## Business Context

Any employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. With an extra added feature to sort alphabetically by name and to filter through employees with the search bar.
